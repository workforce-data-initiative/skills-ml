       " 'description': 'If you are a personable, outgoing and service-oriented professional who wants to manage a dynamic office, come join the Kool Smiles family! Kool Smiles was founded in 2002 and was built on the belief that every family has the right to quality dental care in a clean, safe and fun environment. Our first goal is to provide quality and compliant dental care to individuals in communities that typically get overlooked by other dentists. Our services aren’t just for kids- we know that children are more likely to have great dental habits if mom and dad do too, so we happily care for the entire family. Kool Smiles is looking for a customer-service-oriented leader to fill the role of Office Manager. As the Office Manager, you will manage an office staff of 15 to 30 employees and provide a friendly environment for the numerous patients who come to us for dental care. Job Responsibilities As the Office Manager for Kool Smiles, you will interview and hire new employees as well as coach and counsel existing staff. You will also develop a team atmosphere among office staff and encourage them to perform at their highest level. You will also handle a wide range of organizational and supervisory duties, including: • Ensuring outstanding patient satisfaction • Ensuring compliance standards are met at all times • Achieving office level financial performance targets • Scheduling staff and conducting performance-management programs • Promoting Kool Smiles brand throughout community via local marketing efforts • Maintaining the appearance and overall efficiency of the office Job Requirements As the Manager, you will be the public face of Kool Smiles. You must be professional in your appearance and manner and be able to interact well with children as they comprise approximately 80% of our patients. You must also have excellent problem-solving and verbal and written communication skills. Specific qualifications for the Office Manager position include: • Minimum 5 years experience managing 10 or more direct reports in a customer-service-focused role, preferably in a retail, hospitality, restaurant or medical setting where you had direct and face-to-face interaction with customers • Proficiency with Microsoft Office Suite • Demonstrated ability to drive business results • Public-service experience is a plus, as many of our patients are children from low-income families in medically underserved communities • Bachelor’s degree is preferred, but not required Benefits At Kool Smiles, you will begin your role as Office Manager with a two-week training course in Atlanta. You will also have the opportunity to advance to positions such as District Manager, Area Business Leader, and Certified Office Manager (which involves setting-up and training staff for new Kool Smiles offices.) Additional benefits include: • Medical and dental insurance • 401(k) • Short-term and long-term disability • Bonus plan based on the performance of the office • Paid vacation • Paid holidays Take on a new challenge and make a positive community impact!
