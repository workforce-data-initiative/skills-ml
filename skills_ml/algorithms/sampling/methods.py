    Randomly choosing a sample of k items from a streaming iterator. Using random sort to implement the algorithm.
    Basically, it's assigning random number as keys to each item and maintain k items with minimum value for keys,
    which equals to assigning a random number to each item as key and sort items using these keys and take top k items.

    Args:
        it (iterator): Job posting iterator to sample from

        k (int): Sample size
        weights (dict): a dictionary that has key-value pairs as label-weighting pairs. It expects every

                        weights = {'11': 2, '13', 1}. In this case, the label/key is the occupation major
                        group and the value is the weight you want to sample with.
