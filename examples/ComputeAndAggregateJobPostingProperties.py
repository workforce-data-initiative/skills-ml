"""Computing and aggregating job posting properties

To show job posting property computation and aggregation,
we calculate job posting counts by cleaned title, and upload
the resulting CSV to S3.

This is essentially a mini version of the Data@Work Research Hub.

To enable this example to be run with as few dependencies as possible, we use:
- a fake local s3 instance
- a sample of the Virginia Tech open job postings dataset
- only title cleaning and job counting.

To make this example a little bit more interesting, one could incorporate more
classes from the job_posting_properties.computers module, such as skill extractors or geocoders.
